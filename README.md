# Freshman Year C Programming Assignments

This repository contains all the C programming assignments I completed during my freshman year. These assignments are a mixture of basic to advanced C problems that help beginners get a grasp of the language.

## Repository Structure:
Each C program is named according to a unique identifier. If the identifier is a four-digit number, it corresponds directly to the problem number. If the identifier is of the form 132E, the last digit (E in this case) represents the question number for that week, the second-to-last digit (2 here) signifies if it's an experimental question (2) or a practical question (1), and the first one or two digits represent the week number.

Sample Code:
```c
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<string.h>
#define PI 3.14159265

//1851//
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXN 100
#define MAXW 1000

int max(int a, int b) {
    return a > b ? a : b;
}

... // (Code truncated for brevity)

```
## Running the Code:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the desired C file.
Compile the C code using a C compiler, e.g., gcc 1851.c -o 1851.out.
Run the compiled code, e.g., ./1851.out.
## Dependencies:
A C compiler, such as GCC.
Basic understanding of C programming concepts.
## Contributing:
While this repository primarily serves as an archive of my freshman assignments, any feedback or suggestions for improvement are always welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any recommendations.
